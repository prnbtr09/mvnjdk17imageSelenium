FROM maven:3-amazoncorretto-17-debian: This tells Docker to pull the base image from Docker Hub, which presumably has Maven and Amazon Corretto (a distribution of OpenJDK) pre-installed.

RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install...: The RUN instruction will execute commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. The committed image will be used for the next step in the Dockerfile. This particular RUN statement is updating the list of packages in the Debian package manager (apt) and then installing necessary packages for the next steps.

RUN wget...: This command downloads the signing key for the Google Chrome repository and adds it to apt's keyring, ensuring that the received packages are trusted.

RUN echo "deb [arch=amd64]...: This command adds the Google Chrome repository to the sources.list.d directory, which apt uses to determine where to fetch packages from.

RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install...: This updates the package list again, now including the newly added Google Chrome repository, and installs the latest stable version of Google Chrome.

RUN apt-get clean && rm -rf...: This is a clean-up step to reduce the size of the image by removing unnecessary files and package lists after the installation. It's considered a best practice to clean up in the same layer where the installation occurs to keep the overall image size small.

WORKDIR /usr/src/app: Sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow in the Dockerfile. If the specified directory does not exist, it will be created automatically. This is set as the directory where your app's source code would be placed inside the container.
